# Clean Architecture & TDD TypeScript Project

This is a TypeScript project that follows the principles of Clean Architecture and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Description

This project is structured around the Clean Architecture methodology, which promotes the separation of concerns, making the system more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. It uses a layered approach to structure the system into independent modules.

The project also adheres to the principles of TDD, where tests are written before the actual code. This ensures that the codebase is thoroughly tested and that each component works as expected.
