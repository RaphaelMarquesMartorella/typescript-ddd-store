# DDD & TDD TypeScript Project

This is a TypeScript project that follows the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Description

This project is structured around the DDD methodology, which focuses on core domain logic and complex business rules. It uses a rich, expressive, and evolving model to tackle complexity in the heart of the software.

The project also adheres to the principles of TDD, where tests are written before the actual code. This ensures that the codebase is thoroughly tested and that each component works as expected.
